However, the current pandemic and the proposition of being stuck in southern Italy for the near future (going back to the USA wasn't an option at the time) had me considering what would be my next step. Enter the world of artificial intelligence. I first started thinking about this field a few years ago while working on my graduation thesis and studying public health epidemiology. I even went so far as to inquire about the program and the University of Bologna, but it was a) too expensive, b) too long, and c)seemed too business-oriented. I was looking for an intersection of A.I, public and clinical medicine. Enter Strive School. I'll make an entire post of strive school at a later date but suffice to say it was a better fit than all of the other schools I had researched--It lies somewhere between an overly long boot camp but less than a full university program. Once accepted, you hit the ground running by configuring your computer with anaconda, learning python, trigonometry, linear algebra, and calculus. Then after learning to scrape the data, you start the meat of the program, machine learning. <strong><em>Update, I had to resign from the program with about 8 weeks left, but USMLE exams take presidence!</em> </strong>However, everything that I've learn over these past few weeks inspired me to start a blog and website. So here we are at my little place on the web. Here I will talk about my strive school experience, coding in general, artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular, and talk about my other areas of expertise, clinical and population medicine, and how those areas deal with the previous topics. I hope to make this space enjoyable for some who may have a medical degree or for those with other health sciences type of degree that want to delve into research-oriented tasks. For others, I hope that I can share typical insights into how it is to learn coding from scratch without a traditional course of study at a university. Welcome.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
